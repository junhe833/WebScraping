WebScraping

The purpose of this script is to extract data (all seasonal show's name/genre/ratings/episode countdown) from two different 
websites and sort them by their respective rating from highest to lowest. The result will be saved into a text file. 

A sample file has been uploaded called "output".

This script was written in Python using headed browser (Firefox) which can be changed to headless browser (phantomJS) 
to improve its performance.
