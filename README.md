WebScraping

The purpose of this script is to extract data (all seasonal show's name/genre/ratings/episode countdown) from two different 
websites and sort them by their respective rating from highest to lowest. The result will be saved into a text file. 

A sample file has been uploaded called "output".

"Firefox.py" was written in Python using headed browser (Firefox) while "PhantomJS.py" uses headless browser (phantomJS) 
for improved performance.
