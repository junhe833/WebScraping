# WebScraping

The purpose of this script is to extract data (all seasonal show's name/genre/ratings/episode countdown) using HTTP requests from two different websites and sort them by their respective rating from highest to lowest. 

The result will be saved into a text file. A sample file has been uploaded called "output".

https://www.livechart.me is used to extract the upcoming episode countdown for all seasonal show.

http://myanimelist.net/anime/season is used to extract rating and genre for all seasonal show.
