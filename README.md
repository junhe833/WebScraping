WebScraping

The purpose of this script is to extract data (all seasonal show's name/genre/ratings/episode countdown) from two different 
websites and sort them by their respective rating from highest to lowest. The result will be saved into a text file. 


The script "WebScraping.py" was written in Python. It prompts the user to choose a web browser to extract data.

"PhantomJS.exe" is a stand-alone executable which employs a headless browser (a web browser without GUI) for improved performance.

A sample file has been uploaded called "output".
